# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## changes

In this project I've modified the HTML and CSS.
Also I've add a bunch of code using JS to do these things:
- Adding the navbar list of links.
- Scrolling will make the section active with the associated link in the navbar.
- Go to the section when click on associated the link in navbar.
- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
- Add a scroll to the top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
- Update/change the design/content **Some of them by JS**.
- Make sections collapsible.
- Make the landing page responsive.
- ect.

Note: I added `/* new */` on the style.css page to highlight added code by mine
