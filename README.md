# Landing Page Project

## An interactive one page project

### Description
One page interactive project, its source from Udacity, and I've modified its HTML and CSS pages also I've added JS to make it interactive. 

- Adding the navbar list of links.
- Scrolling will make the section active with the associated link in the navbar.
- Go to the section when click on its associated link in the navbar.
- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
- Add a scroll to the top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
- Update/change the design/content **Some of them by JS**.
- Make sections collapsible.
- Make the landing page responsive.

Note: I added `/* new */` on the style.css page to highlight added code by mine
